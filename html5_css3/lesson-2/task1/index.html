    <h1>HTML Basics</h1>

    <p id="anchor">
      <strong>HTML Basics</strong> contain the fundamental rules of the HTML
      language, the description of the HTML page structure, and the
      relationships in the structure of an HTML document between HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>HTML document</strong> — is an ordinary text document, it can be
      created in a simple text editor (Notepad) or in a specialized one with
      code highlighting (Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc.). An HTML document
      has the extension <em>.html</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An HTML document consists of a <strong>tree of HTML elements</strong> and
      text. Each element is denoted in the source document by an opening and a
      closing tag (with rare exceptions).
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening tag indicates where the element starts, and the closing tag
      indicates where it ends. The closing tag is formed by adding a slash /
      before the tag name. The content of the tag — the content — is located
      between the opening and closing tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tags can be nested within each other. When nesting, the order of their
      closing must be observed (the "matryoshka" principle).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML elements can have attributes (global, applicable to all HTML
      elements, and specific ones). Attributes are specified in the opening tag
      of the element and contain a name and a value, specified in the format
      name="value". Attributes allow changing the properties and behavior of the
      element for which they are set.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the markup is correct, then the browser window will display an HTML
      page containing HTML elements — headings, tables, images, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interpretation process (<strong><em>parsing</em></strong
      >) begins before the web page is fully loaded into the browser. Browsers
      process HTML documents sequentially, starting from the very beginning,
      while processing CSS and associating style sheets with page elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      An HTML document consists of two sections — the header — between the
      "<strong>head</strong>" tags, and the content part — between the "<strong>body</strong>" tags.
