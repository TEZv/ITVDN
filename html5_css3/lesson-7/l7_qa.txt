Q: What property is prescribed to enable flexbox?
A:🔹display: flex; ==> makes elements displayed horizontally (row by default), every parent as a block element
  🔸display: inline-flex;  ==> the same from `display: flex;` BUT every parent as an inline element (near 1:1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What properties work with the main and transverse axis? Describe everyone's behavior value?
A: -->💡justify-content ==> child flex-item main flow (axis)
      🔹🔸==> justify-content: flex-start; (default)
      🔹🔸==> justify-content: flex-end;
      🔹🔸==> justify-content: center;
      🔹🔸==> justify-content: space-between;
      🔹🔸==> justify-content: space-around;

   -->💡align-items ==> child flex-item cross flow (axis)
      🔹🔸==> align-items: flex-start; (default)
      🔹🔸==> align-items: flex-end;
      🔹🔸==> align-items: center;
      🔹🔸==> align-items: baseline;

Q: What are the dimensions of the flex item when:
A: ||🌺 not spelled out the width of the element and there is only text?
    🔹🔸the dimensions of the flex item will be determined BY the CONTENT inside it
   
      -->💡the flex item will EXPAND or SHRINK to fit the WIDTH of its CONTENT.

   ||🌺 not spelled out the width of the element and without content?
    🔹🔸the dimensions of the flex item will collapse to ZERO WIDTH and HEIGHT

      -->📍`Width`: Without content or an explicitly set width, 
                  the flex item will collapse horizontally to ZERO width.
      -->📍`Height`: Similarly, without content or specific height, 
                  the flex item will collapse vertically to ZERO height.

   ||🌺 the specified width and it is greater than the provided width of the container flex?
    🔹🔸flex items will not overflow the flex container

      -->💡flex items will shrink to fit the available space
      -->💡flex items will maintain their original size if they cannot shrink further

      -->💡'Flex items' can overflow the container only under specific circumstances:

         📍If the flex container has a fixed width or height set, and the combined widths or heights 
        of the flex items exceed these dimensions.
         📍If the flex container has the overflow property set to hidden or scroll, 
        causing any overflowed content to be hidden or scrolled within the container.

   ||🌺 is the specified width less than the provided width of the container flex?
    🔹🔸the flex item will typically be displayed at its specified width
    
      -->📍any REMAINING space within the container will be DISTRIBUTED 
      AMONG the OTHER flex items according to their `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` properties.
      -->📍justify-content: flex-start;  (default) ==> the flex item will be to the left within the container
