    <h2>Need for Use</h2>
    <p>
      Using key combinations allows you to simplify the execution of constantly
      repeated or simple actions that require a couple or more clicks (left and
      right mouse button presses), which significantly increases the number of
      actions performed with the keyboard.
    </p>

    <h2>Using Key Combinations</h2>
    <p>As an example, let's consider the key combination Ctrl+Shift+d.</p>
    <p>
      You should not press the keys sequentially (like in calculators) or
      simultaneously (like playing a piano chord). First, you need to press and
      hold the Ctrl and Shift keys, and without releasing them, press the d key.
      The Ctrl and Shift keys held at the moment of pressing d modify the action
      of the d key. That is, when pressing the d key, the primary action (typing
      the d character) will not be executed, but one of the "secondary" actions
      (Duplication) will be performed.
